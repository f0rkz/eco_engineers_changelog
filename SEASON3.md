# Changelog for Eco Engineers Season 3

## 08.09.2020:09:50:00 EST

Welcome new players! The server is up and running.

## 08.10.2020:10:00:00 EST

The server will be taken down at 12:00:00 EST (noon) for a quick change to the backup directory location. In order to support longer backup retention, we will be storing backups on a NAS.

The server will be down for approximately 10 minutes during this maintenance.

Please join us in discord for discussion.

Scheduled downtime for 08.11.2020:12:00:00 EST

The server will be going down shortly for a quick system update. The total expected downtime is 5 minutes.

## 08.11.2020:12:37:00 EST

Scheduled downtime was a little late today, apologies.

The system has been patched and latencies seem to be reporting better in the initial client tests.

Server is back up and running. Enjoy!
